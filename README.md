# Guides and Workshops

## General Introduction

****

**Welcome to the Oracle Onboarding!**

This document/page will be your guide to learn how to navigate, manage and use your Oracle Cloud. The general introduction will address general topics such as the log in, regions etc.  

Just a short reminder, the Oracle Cloud offers a complete set of cloud services:

* Infrastructure as a Service

Use Oracle Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings to quickly set up the virtual machines, storage, and networking capabilities you need to run just about any kind of workload. Your infrastructure is managed, hosted, and supported by Oracle.

* Platform as a Service

Use Oracle Platform as a Service offerings to provision ready-to-use environments for your enterprise IT and development teams, so they can build and deploy applications, based on proven Oracle databases and application servers.

* Software as a Service

Use Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings to run your business from the Cloud. Oracle offers cloud-based solutions for Human Capital Management, Enterprise Resource Planning, Supply Chain Management, and many other applications, all managed, hosted, and supported by Oracle.

  ### About Oracle Data Regions

When you sign up for an Oracle Cloud Account, you must select a Data Region, which is a geographic region that contains one or more Oracle Cloud data centers.

When deciding upon a default Data Region, you should consider:

* The location of the Data Region.

Ideally, the data region should be as close to your cloud service users as possible. See Data Regions for Platform and Infrastructure Services for a world map of Oracle Data Region locations.

~~* The services available in each Data Region.~~

~~Not all cloud services are available in every Data Region. If you are interested in using a specific Oracle Cloud Service, see Data Regions for Platform and Infrastructure Services, and review the table of services below the map. It lists all the Cloud services and indicates the Data Regions where each service is available.~~

* Any restrictions or guidelines for the country in which you reside.

For some specific countries, you might have to select a specific data center or keep in mind certain restrictions. See Data Regions for Platform and Infrastructure Services, and review the notes at the bottom of the page, which list the additional considerations when selecting a data region.

### Oracle Cloud Terminology

As you start using Oracle Cloud, it helps to understand the basic terminology we use to describe the Oracle Cloud features and services.


**Data center**
 
A facility used to house computer systems and associated components. 
 
Oracle provides data centers in various geographical regions. An identity domain and the services associated with that domain must belong to a specific data center.
****
**Data region**
 
A geographical region that’s associated with one or more data centers. When you sign up for an Oracle Cloud account, you select a default data region, where your services will be hosted. 
****
**Identity domain**
 
A domain that controls the authentication and authorization of the users who can sign in to an Oracle Cloud service and which features they can access. An Oracle Cloud service in a traditional cloud account must belong to an identity domain.
****
**Oracle Account**

Oracle Account is a unique customer account and can correspond to an individual, an organization, or a company that is an Oracle customer.

This account gives you access to the Oracle.com website, which includes your access to applications, communities, and Oracle Technology Network (OTN).

Note the following:

* An Oracle Account is different from an Oracle Cloud Account that you use to access your cloud services.

* For Oracle Infrastructure as a Service (Oracle IaaS) or Oracle Platform as a Service (Oracle PaaS) offerings, an Oracle account is no longer required if you’re signing up for the Free Oracle Cloud Promotion or for a new Oracle Cloud account.

* An Oracle Account is required if you’re using Oracle Store to purchase services or if you sign up for certain traditional metered Oracle PaaS offerings that are part of the Free Oracle Cloud Promotion.

* An Oracle Account is also required when logging support or service requests in My Oracle Support.
****
**Oracle Cloud account**

Use this account to access your cloud services and to sign in to the My Services dashboard, where you manage your account and your services.

There are two types of Oracle Cloud accounts: traditional cloud accounts (also known as Cloud Service accounts) and cloud accounts with Oracle Identity Cloud Service.
****
**Service**

A Software offered in Oracle Cloud
****
**Service console**

The unique console of a service or the administrator console if the service has both an administrator console and a user console
****
**Service Entitlement**

Service entitlements represent the right to use Oracle Cloud services, based on the resources you’ve purchased or the rights assigned to you by your Cloud Account administrator.
****
**Service instance**

The existence of a cloud service, for example, an instance of Oracle Java Cloud Service
****
**Service instance URL**

The web address (URL) that you use to access a provisioned service instance.
****
**Service name**

A name assigned to your Oracle Cloud service. The service name must be unique in the identity domain. You can add a longer description to help you identify the service after it’s activated.
****
**Service notification**

An event reported on the My Services dashboard in the Message center. Notifications provide information about upcoming events such as system outages or blackouts, service maintenance, promotion expiry, or resource quota breach.
