# Autonomous Data Warehouse - Machine Learning

Services for this guide:

* Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse
* Oracle Autonomous Transactional Processing
* Oracle Analytics Cloud

## Overview

* Collaborate
* Predict
* Analyze and report
* Visualize

Oracle Machine Learning:

* Is a collaborative web-based interface
* Provides a development environment to create data mining notebooks
* Enables data analytics, data discovery, and data visualizations
* Is compatible and is deployed along with Oracle Autonomous Database services

Oracle Machine Learning is a **SQL notebook interface** for data scientists to perform machine learning in the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) (and ATP). 

Notebook technologies support the **creation of scripts** while supporting the documentation of assumptions, approaches, and rationale to increase data science team productivity. 

Oracle Machine Learning SQL notebooks, based on **Apache Zeppelin** technology, enable teams to collaborate to build, evaluate, and deploy predictive models and analytical methodologies in the Oracle ADW/ATP. 

**Multi-user collaboration** enables the same notebook to be opened simultaneously by different users. Changes made by one user are **immediately updated** for other team members.

Oracle Machine Learning SQL notebooks provide easy access to Oracle's **parallelized, scalable in-database implementations** of a library of Oracle Advanced Analytics Algorithm's (classification, regression, anomaly detection, clustering, associations, attribute importance, feature extraction, times series, etc.), SQL, PL/SQL and Oracle's statistical and analytical SQL functions.

Oracle Machine Learning SQL notebooks and Oracle Advanced Analytics' library of machine learning SQL functions combined with PL/SQL allow companies to automate their discovery of new insights, generate predictions, and add "AI" to data via dashboards and enterprise applications. 

To support enterprise requirements for security, authentication, and auditing, Oracle Machine 
Learning SQL notebooks adhere to all **Oracle standards and support privilege-based access** to data, models, and notebooks.

## Why Oracle Machine Learning?

* It has the potential to unlocking the value of corporate and customer data.
* Can assist in strategic decision making, which can keep a company ahead of the competition
* It is going to change the ways humans operate more than any technology that’s ever existed

## Machine Learning Use Cases

_...really quick_

**Financial services**

Banks and other businesses in the financial industry use machine learning technology for two key purposes: to identify **important insights** in data, and **prevent fraud**. The insights can identify investment opportunities, or help investors know when to trade. Data mining can also identify clients with high-risk profiles, or use cyber surveillance to pinpoint warning signs of fraud.

**Health Care**

Machine learning is a fast-growing trend in the health care industry, thanks to the advent of wearable devices and sensors that can use data to **assess a patient's health in real time**. The technology can also help medical experts analyze data to identify trends or red flags that may lead to improved diagnoses and treatment.

**Oil and gas**

Finding new energy sources, analyzing minerals in the ground, predicting refinery sensor failure, streamlining oil distribution to make it more efficient and cost-effective: the number of machine learning use cases for this industry is vast – and still expanding.

**Transportation**

Analyzing data to identify patterns and trends is key to the transportation industry, which relies on making routes more efficient and predicting potential problems to increase profitability. The data analysis and modelling aspects of machine learning are important tools to delivery companies, public transportation, and other transportation organizations. 

**Marketing and Sales**

Websites recommending items you might like based on previous purchases are using machine learning to analyze your buying history – and promote other items you'd be interested in. This ability to capture data, analyze it and use it to personalize a shopping experience (or implement a marketing campaign) is the future of retail.

**Government**

Government agencies such as public safety and utilities have a particular need for machine learning since they have multiple sources of data that can be mined for insights. Analyzing sensor data, for example, identifies ways to increase efficiency and save money.  

Machine learning can also help detect fraud and minimize identity theft.
