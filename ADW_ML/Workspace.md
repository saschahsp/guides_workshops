A project is a **container** for your **notebooks**, and a **workspace** is a container for your **projects**. You can own multiple projects in a workspace. 

The initial workspace and the **default project** is created by the Oracle Machine Learning service automatically when you log in to Oracle Machine Learning for the first time. To create a new project and a workspace: 

On the top right corner of Oracle Machine Learning home page, click the project workspace drop-down list. The project name and the workspace, in which the project resides, are displayed. 

**Note**:The last project that you have worked on is stored in the browser cache and is the default project. If you clear the cache, then no default exists and you must select a project.

A workspace is an area where you can store your projects, and share with other users to collaborate in your project.
