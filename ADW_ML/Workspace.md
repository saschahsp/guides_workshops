A project is a **container** for your **notebooks**, and a **workspace** is a container for your **projects**. You can own multiple projects in a workspace. 

The initial workspace and the **default project** is created by the Oracle Machine Learning service automatically when you log in to Oracle Machine Learning for the first time. To create a new project and a workspace: 

On the top right corner of Oracle Machine Learning home page, click the project workspace **drop-down list**. The project name and the workspace, in which the project resides, are displayed. The menu will also give you access to Recent Projects, New Project, Manage Workspaces and Workspace Permissions. 

**Note**: The **last project** that you have worked on is stored in the browser **cache** and is the default project. If you clear the cache, then no default exists and you must select a project.

A workspace is an area where you can **store** your projects, and share with other users to collaborate in your project.

You can provide access to the workspace, **manage permissions** for users, and edit and delete a workspace

For **collaborating with other** users, you can provide different levels of **permission** such as VIEWER, DEVELOPER, or Manager
