## Abstract

This Hands-On will make you ready to start your Data Science Project in no time. The Hands-On will display how to use the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and the Object Storage as Data Sources for your projects. 

On top of that, you will learn how to build your own Machine Learning Pipeline with Python. Both "general" Machine Learning and Deep Learning will be introduced. In the end we will use a served Machine Learning model to predict your facial expression.

    1. Import Libraries
    2. Object Storage
    3. ~~cx_Oracle~~
    4. Fashion MINST
        1. Load Data
        2. Show Example; array to "heatmap"
        3. Normalize
        4. Grid of examples; greyscales
        5. Define model
        6. Compile model
        7. Fit model
        8. test loss / acc
        9. Visualize predictions
        10. New images
7. Facial Expression App

## Before we start!

You can find a **username** and **password** on your table. You will use this to connect to the Jupyter Hub which runs your Jupyter Notebook. This is the main tool, we will use to conduct our Hands-On. 

**Log-In here:** ___

In order to work with ADW and the Object Storage, you need credentials for ADW and a user with an API token for the Object Storage.

The config file...

The credentials...
