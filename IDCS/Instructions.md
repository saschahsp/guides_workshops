Adaptive Security is an advanced feature that provides strong authentication capabilities for your users, based on their behavior within Oracle Identity Cloud Service, and across multiple heterogeneous on-premises applications and cloud services.

When activated, the Adaptive Security feature can analyze a userâ€™s risk profile within Oracle Identity Cloud Service based on their historical behavior, such as too many unsuccessful login attempts, too many unsuccessful MFA attempts, and real-time device context like logins from unknown devices, access from unknown locations, blacklisted IP addresses, and so on. 

* Identity Providers

Add, manage, and use identity providers

An identity provider, known as an Identity Assertion provider, provides identifiers for users who want to interact with Oracle Identity Cloud Service using a website that's external to Oracle Identity Cloud Service. A service provider is a website such as Oracle Identity Cloud Service that hosts applications. You can enable an identity provider and define one or more service providers. Your users can then access the applications hosted by the service providers directly from the identity provider.

**Compartments**

![](https://github.com/saschahsp/guides_workshops/blob/master/IDCS/img/24.PNG)

A collection of related resources. Compartments are a fundamental component of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for organizing and isolating your cloud resources. You use them to clearly separate resources for the purposes of measuring usage and billing, access (through the use of policies), and isolation (separating the resources for one project or business unit from another). A common approach is to create a compartment for each major part of your organization. The compartments are herarchisch, meaning it starts with the root and branches out to child compartments, which can have their own child compartments. 

**Policies**

24. Navigate to the Policies tab

![](https://github.com/saschahsp/guides_workshops/blob/master/IDCS/img/25.PNG)

A document that specifies who can access which resources, and how. Access is granted at the group and compartment level, which means you can write a policy that gives a group a specific type of access within a specific compartment, or to the tenancy itself. If you give a group access to the tenancy, the group automatically gets the same type of access to all the compartments inside the tenancy. For more information, see Example Scenario and How Policies Work. The word "policy" is used by people in different ways: to mean an individual statement written in the policy language; to mean a collection of statements in a single, named "policy" document (which has an Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) assigned to it); and to mean the overall body of policies your organization uses to control access to resources.
