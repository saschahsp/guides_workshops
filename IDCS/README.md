**Oracle Identity Cloud Service** provides identity management, single sign-on (SSO), and identity governance for applications on-premise, in the cloud, or for mobile devices. Employees and business partners can access applications at any time, from anywhere, and on any device in a secure manner. Oracle Identity Cloud Service integrates directly with existing directories and identity management systems, and makes it easy for users to get access to applications. 

Administrators and users can use Oracle Identity Cloud Service to help them effectively and securely create, manage, and use a cloud-based identity management environment without worrying about setting up any infrastructure or platform details.

1.	Integrate Identity Management into your custom applications using open APIs.
2.	Integrate with any application using open standards - OpenID Connect, SAML, OAuth and SCIM.
  a.	 OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization on the Internet
  b.	System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is a standard for automating the exchange of user identity information between identity domains, or IT systems
  c.	Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a standard protocol for web browser Single Sign-On (SSO) using secure tokens. SAML completely eliminates all passwords and instead uses standard cryptography and digital signatures 	to pass a secure sign-in token from an identity provider to a SaaS application.
  d.	OpenID allows you to use an existing account to sign in to multiple websites, without needing to create new passwords.

Run business critical workloads on a verifiably secure infrastructure that follows rigorous processes and security controls in all phases of development and operation.
