### ADW ML



### Tribuo

Machine learning in pure Java.

Tribuo is a machine learning framework written in Java. It provides tools for classification, regression, clustering, model development, and more. It also provides a unified interface to many popular third-party ML libraries like xgboost and liblinear.

### PredictionIO

Apache PredictionIO® is an open source Machine Learning Server built on top of a state-of-the-art open source stack for developers and data scientists to create predictive engines for any machine learning task.

Apache PredictionIO® can be installed as a full machine learning stack, bundled with Apache Spark, MLlib, HBase, Akka HTTP and Elasticsearch, which simplifies and accelerates scalable machine learning infrastructure management.

### Spark Streaming

### Cloudera Data Science Workbench

### Apache Livy

A REST Service for Apache Spark

Apache Livy is a service that enables easy interaction with a Spark cluster over a REST interface. It enables easy submission of Spark jobs or snippets of Spark code, synchronous or asynchronous result retrieval, as well as Spark Context management, all via a simple REST interface or an RPC client library. Apache Livy also simplifies the interaction between Spark and application servers, thus enabling the use of Spark for interactive web/mobile applications. Additional features include:

* Have long running Spark Contexts that can be used for multiple Spark jobs, by multiple clients
* Share cached RDDs or Dataframes across multiple jobs and clients
* Multiple Spark Contexts can be managed simultaneously, and the Spark Contexts run on the cluster (YARN/Mesos) instead of the Livy Server, for good fault tolerance and concurrency
* Jobs can be submitted as precompiled jars, snippets of code or via java/scala client API
* Ensure security via secure authenticated communication
